My research interests lie in Digital Humanities, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. Specifically, I explore how large language models (LLMs) may be applied to the study of literary texts, with a dual interest in developing research methods and tools for humanities scholars and using literary texts as challenging test cases with which to explore the real-world capabilities of LLMs. In the summer of 2024 I worked as a research assistant for <a href="https://www.au.dk/en/rdkm@cc.au.dk">Ross Deans Kristensen-McLachlan</a> at the <a href="https://chc.au.dk">Center for Humanities Computing</a> at Aarhus University.<br><br>
In 2022, I graduated from Carleton College with a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science and English and a minor in Digital Arts and Humanities. During this time I was advised by <a class="page-link" href="https://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/ealexander/">Eric Alexander</a> and <a class="page-link" href="https://www.carleton.edu/directory/gshuffel/">George Shuffelton</a>. I also participated in the <a class="page-link" href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/research/superb">SUPERB REU</a> at UC Berkeley in the summer of 2021, where I was advised by <a class="page-link" href="https://schasins.com">Sarah Chasins</a> and <a class="page-link" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~adityagp/">Aditya Parameswaran</a>.<br><br>
