My long term goal is to become a professor of Computer Science and my research interests are mostly in Human-Computer Interaction, especially human-centered tool design, data visualization, and digital humanities. I've worked on a variety of projects in these areas, which you can learn about in the <a class="page-link" href="https://rmatouschekh.github.io/projects/">Projects</a> tab. I'm also passionate about teaching, which you can learn more about in the <a class="page-link" href="https://rmatouschekh.github.io/teaching/">Teaching</a> tab.<br><br><span class="home-heading">For Fun</span><br> I'm also an avid ballroom dancer, read as much as I can, and write poetry!</div>
