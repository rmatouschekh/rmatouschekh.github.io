I'm currently applying to graduate school programs, with the eventual goal of becoming a university professor. My research interests are mostly in Human-Computer Interaction, especially human-centered tool design, data visualization, and digital humanities. I've worked on a variety of projects in these areas, which you can learn about in the <b>Projects</b> tab above.<br><br>Outside of class, I'm very invovled with the partner dance community on campus and have been Co-Captain of the Ballroom Dance Team for two years and taught West Coast Swing as a PE class.</div>
