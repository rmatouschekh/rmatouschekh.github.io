I'm currently applying to graduate school programs, with the eventual goal of becoming a university professor. My research interests are mostly in Human-Computer Interaction, especially human-centered tool design, data visualization, and digital humanities. I've worked on a variety of projects in these areas, which you can learn about in the <span style="font-style: italic; color:#00b359;">Projects</span> tab above.
