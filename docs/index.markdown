I'm currently applying to graduate school programs, with the eventual goal of becoming a university professor. My research interests are mostly in Human-Computer Interaction, especially human-centered tool design, data visualization, and digital humanities. I've worked on a variety of projects in these areas, which you can learn about in the <a class="page-link" href="https://rmatouschekh.github.io/projects/">Projects</a> tab. I'm also passionate about teaching, which you can learn more about in the <a class="page-link" href="https://rmatouschekh.github.io/teaching/">Teaching</a> tab.<br><br><span class="home-heading">For Fun</span><br>Outside of class, I'm invovled in the partner dance community on campus. I have been Co-Captain of the Ballroom Dance Team for two years and taught West Coast Swing as a PE class. I also write poetry, knit, and read as much as I can!</div>
