My research interests lie in computational humanities research, natural language processing, and cultural analytics. Specifically, I explore how large language models (LLMs) can be use for complex textual, particularly literary, analysis tasks. My interest is both in developing research methods and tools for humanities scholars and using literary texts as challenging test cases with which to explore the real-world capabilities of LLMs. In the summer of 2024 I worked as a research assistant for <a href="https://www.au.dk/en/rdkm@cc.au.dk">Ross Deans Kristensen-McLachlan</a> at the <a href="https://chc.au.dk">Center for Humanities Computing</a> at Aarhus University.<br><br>
In 2022, I graduated from Carleton College with a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science and English and a minor in Digital Arts and Humanities. During this time I was advised by <a class="page-link" href="https://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/ealexander/">Eric Alexander</a> and <a class="page-link" href="https://www.carleton.edu/directory/gshuffel/">George Shuffelton</a>. I also participated in the <a class="page-link" href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/research/superb">SUPERB REU</a> at UC Berkeley in the summer of 2021, where I was advised by <a class="page-link" href="https://schasins.com">Sarah Chasins</a> and <a class="page-link" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~adityagp/">Aditya Parameswaran</a>.<br><br>
