<div style="width:50%;float:left;text-align: center;border-radius: 25px;"><img src="assets/images/Hicke.jpeg" alt="Photo of Rebecca Hicke" width="275" height="250" style="margin-top:40px;"></div><div style="margin-left:50%; width:50%;"><br>I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a class="page-link" href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>, where I am advised by Professor <a class="page-link" href="https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu">David Mimno</a>. My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing, Digital Humanities, and Cultural Analytics. Specifically, I explore how large language models (LLMs) may be applied to the study of literary texts, with a dual interest in learning more about literature itself and using literary texts as challenging test cases with which to explore the real-world capabilities of LLMs.<br><br>
In 2022, I graduated from <a class="page-link" href="https://www.carleton.edu">Carleton College</a> with a Bachelors of Arts <emph>cum laude</emph> in Computer Science and English and a minor in Digital Arts and Humanities. During this time I had the privilege of being advised by Professor <a class="page-link" href="https://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/ealexander/">Eric Alexander</a> and Professor <a class="page-link" href="https://www.carleton.edu/directory/gshuffel/">George Shuffelton</a>. I also participated in the <a class="page-link" href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/research/superb">SUPERB REU</a> at <a class="page-link" href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> in the summer of 2021, where I was honored to be advised by Professor <a class="page-link" href="https://schasins.com">Sarah Chasins</a> and Professor <a class="page-link" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~adityagp/">Aditya Parameswaran</a>.<br><br>
