<div class="project-title">Tools for Tracking Police Misconduct Data</div>
<div class="project-content">Advised by Professor <a href="https://schasins.com">Sarah Chasins</a> and Professor <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~adityagp/">Aditya Parameswaran</a> @ UC Berkeley</div>
<div class ="time">Summer 2021 – present</div>
<div class="tiny-spacer"></div>
<div class="project-content">Tools for Tracking Police Misconduct Data works on creating a database to help the <a href="https://www.nacdl.org">National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers</a> track police officer misconduct. As part of this project, I iteratively designed MongoDB database queries to find officer misconduct cases, wrote code to output the results of those queries to a Postgres database, and created a website hosted with Flask to allow users to validate those results and then output the results to the database. I have also worked on extracting information from difficult-to-process PDFs. During the summer, I also participated in the <a href="https://plait-lab.org">PLAIT Lab</a> reading group and social events.</div>

<div class="project-title">Word Clouds in the Wild</div>
<div class="project-content">Advised by Professor <a href="https://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/ealexander/">Eric Alexander</a> @ Carleton College</div>
<div class ="time">Summer 2020 – present</div>
<div class="tiny-spacer"></div>
<div class="project-content">This project aims to discover how word clouds are being used with the eventual goal of designing guidelines for creating visually pleasing but effective word clouds. Along with Professor Alexander and another undergraduate researcher, I used grounded theory, a method of qualitative data analysis that involves hypothesis formation through data collection, to study word cloud usage in digital humanities academia and journalism. I also analyzed the collected data. We are currently writing up these results for publication.</div>

<div class="project-title">Practicum 2.0</div>
<div class="project-content">Advised by Professor <a href="https://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/awb/">Aaron Bauer</a> @ Carleton College</div>
<div class ="time">Winter 2022 – Spring 2022</div>
<div class="tiny-spacer"></div>
<div class="project-content">This will be the senior thesis project for my Computer Science major. As part of a group of CS majors, I will extend existing software called Practicum that teaches introductory computer science concepts. I will be designing and implementing new features for the software and testing the usability of those features. A more detailed description of the project can be found <a href="https://cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/2122/practicum2/index.php">here.</a></div>

<div class="project-title">"Let every work weigh heavy of her worth": Examining How Women Enact Power in Shakespeare’s Comedies through Interactive Speech Pattern Visualizations</div>
<div class="project-content">Advised by Professor <a href="https://www.carleton.edu/directory/gshuffel/">George Shuffelton</a> @ Carleton College – <a href="https://observablehq.com/@hicker/let-every-word-weigh-heavy-of-her-worth">Link to Project</a>< – <i>Received the grade of Distinction</i></div>
<div class ="time">Fall 2022 – Winter 2022</div>
<div class="tiny-spacer"></div>
<div class="project-content">This was my senior thesis project for the English major. I analyzed how women enact power in Shakespeare’s comedies by visualizing their speech patterns. I hand-annotated each comedy for who talks to whom, designed and coded visualizations to present the speech pattern data, and then wrote an essay analyzing the visualizations and contextualizing my work within previous literary and DH analysis of Shakespeare.</div>

<div class="project-title">Using Agglomerative Clustering to Group PDFs by Format</div>
<div class ="time">Fall 2021</div>
<div class="project-content"><a href="https://github.com/rmatouschekh/agglomerative-clustering">Link to project</a></div>
<div class="tiny-spacer"></div>
<div class="project-content">As the final project for my Artificial Intelligence course I wrote an algorithm that uses agglomerative clustering to group PDFs by format. The inputs to the algorithm were abstracted images of the first page of each PDF.</div>

<div class="project-title">Scheme Interpreter in C++</div>
<div class="project-content">Created in partnership</div>
<div class ="time">Spring 2021</div>
<div class="tiny-spacer"></div>
<div class="project-content">Over the course of a term, my partner and I created an interpreter for Scheme in C for the Programming Languages class. We wrote a tokenizer, parser, and interpreter.</div>

<div class="project-title">"What care I for words?": Visualizing Characters' Speech in <i>As You Like It</i></div>
<div class ="time">Winter 2021</div>
<div class="project-content"><a href="https://observablehq.com/d/29cdc0a5b39cd2a9">Link to project</a></div>
<div class="tiny-spacer"></div>
<div class="project-content">I created this digital humanities project for Shakespeare II. I hand annotated Shakespeare’s <i>As You Like It</i> for who talked to whom and processed the data using a Python script. I then created two interactive visualizations in the computational notebook Observable. One allowed users to examine who a character talked to throughout the play and the other showed how two characters talked to each other. I also made an interactive version of my annotations so users could validate my work.</div>

<div class="project-title">Biodiversity in National Parks Visualization</div>
<div class="project-content">Created in partnership</div>
<div class ="time">Winter 2021</div>
<div class="project-content"><a href="https://observablehq.com/d/de2724efec118340">Link to project</a></div>
<div class="tiny-spacer"></div>
<div class="project-content">The Biodiversity in National Parks Visualization is an interactive visualization that presents comparative data on biodiversity in coastal and inland national parks. It was created with JavaScript in Observable and allows users to select what data to compare, click to see more detailed comparisons, and hover over categories to see more information. It was the final project for Data Visualization.</div>

<div class="project-title">Seattle Library Explorer</div>
<div class="project-content">Created in partnership</div>
<div class ="time">Fall 2020</div>
<div class="project-content"><a href="https://github.com/rmatouschekh/seattle-library-explorer">Link to project</a></div>
<div class="tiny-spacer"></div>
<div class="project-content">The Seattle Library Explorer was a full stack project created for my Software Design class. My partner and I used data from kaggle on book checkouts in all the Seattle library branches to populate a database we created with Postgres. We also wrote a website hosted with Flask that uses psycopg2 to query the database.</div>
